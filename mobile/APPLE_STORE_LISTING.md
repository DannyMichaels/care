Track your mood, symptoms, food & medications — all in one place. Care is your personal wellness companion for building healthier habits.

## Description
Care is your personal wellness companion — a place to track how you feel, what you eat, your symptoms, medications, and more, all in one place.

Whether you're managing a chronic condition, building healthier habits, or simply want to be more mindful about your well-being, Care gives you the tools to stay on top of it all.

What you can do with Care:

- Track your mood — log how you're feeling each day and spot patterns over time
- Log symptoms — keep a detailed record of what your body is telling you
- Track food — monitor what you eat and how it affects how you feel
- Manage medications — stay on top of your prescriptions and routines
- Write affirmations — start each day with a positive mindset
- Share with the community — post insights and connect with others on similar journeys

Care was built by someone with IBD who needed a single app to track everything — mood, symptoms, food, and medications — without juggling multiple tools. If you've ever wished for one place to manage your health, Care is for you.

Your data stays yours. Care does not share your personal information with third parties.
